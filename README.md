# Shoot-And-Survive 

## :zap: About
This is a simple shooting game I made using the Godot Game Engine! The objective is to survive for as long as you can by shooting and collecting random dropped items. 

## :desktop_computer: How to run locally
I have not yet exported the project. So you'll need to run it using the Godot engine itself. Just clone the repository and import `project.godot` into the engine!

## :grey_question: Controls
`W`, `A`, `S` and `D` or the corresponding arrow keys! Click to shoot!
